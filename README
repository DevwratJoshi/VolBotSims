This repository contains the simulations and simulation data for swarm robots using the Brazil Nut Effect. The simulations use the box2d_for_processing library by Daniel Shiffman. 
Some of the simuations folders are there for testing and debugging. 
The simulations used for research papers will be added to appropriately named folders in this repository.
